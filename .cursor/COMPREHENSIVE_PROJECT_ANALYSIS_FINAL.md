## Detailed Analysis by Component

### 1. Models Analysis

**Strengths:**
- 50+ well-defined models with proper relationships
- Comprehensive use of Laravel features (traits, scopes, accessors)
- Proper use of fillable/guarded properties
- Good use of model events and observers

**Key Models Reviewed:**
- `User` (446 lines) - Comprehensive user management with roles
- `Company` (278 lines) - Complete company profile management
- `Job` (739 lines) - Extensive job posting system
- `Candidate` (331 lines) - Detailed candidate profiles

**Recommendations:**

**Routes Tested:**
- Admin routes: `admin.jobs.*`, `admin.candidates.*`, `admin.dashboard`
- Public routes: `jobs.index`, `companies.index`, `front.home`
- Authentication: `login`, `register`
- Utility routes: `states-list`, `cities-list`, `theme.mode`

### 4. Frontend Analysis

**Strengths:**
- Modern Blade templating with components
- Responsive design implementation
- Good use of Laravel's asset compilation
- Multi-language support

**Areas for Improvement:**
