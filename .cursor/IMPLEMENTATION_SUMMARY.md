### 3. **Controller Fat Logic**
- **Problem**: Business logic mixed with presentation logic
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPROVED** - Service layer implemented for separation of concerns

### 4. **Missing Validation**
- **Problem**: No proper form request validation
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Comprehensive form requests implemented

### 5. **Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Problem**: Missing authorization and input validation
- **Status**: ✅ **IMPROVED** - Policies and validation implemented

## 🛠️ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `PROJECT_ANALYSIS_AND_FIXES.md` - Comprehensive analysis and solutions
- `app/Services/UserService.php` - User business logic service
- `app/Services/CompanyService.php` - Company business logic service
- `app/Http/Requests/StoreCompanyRequest.php` - Company creation validation

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Resolve Memory Issues (HIGH PRIORITY)**
```bash
# Server-level PHP configuration needed
sudo nano /etc/php/8.3/cli/php.ini
# Set: memory_limit = 1024M
# Set: max_execution_time = 600

# Or use environment variables
export MEMORY_LIMIT=1024M
export MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=600
```

### 2. **Complete Model Enhancements**
- Update User model with constants and improved relationships
- Enhance Job model with proper scopes and validation
- Add missing model factories for testing

### 3. **Implement Enhanced Controllers**
- Update CompanyController to use service layer
- Add proper error handling and response formatting
- Implement API controllers with consistent responses

### 4. **Database Optimization**
- Add proper indexes for frequently queried columns
- Optimize existing queries with eager loading
- Implement database query monitoring

### 5. **Testing Implementation**
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Add feature tests for critical user flows
- Implement browser tests for UI functionality
